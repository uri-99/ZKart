This is a webapp for the Market Makers

Here they will be able to view the incoming products in real time

They will also be able to reserve the orders

and eventually submit the ZKEmail proof and the CashOut function.

Currently the SPA queries the blockchain directly, avoiding the need of an API.

Later we could implement a database of all smart contract movements to facilitate the MM to view his "profile". History, pending, etc.
